/* ---- The boxed-receiver face table ----

   A call on a receiver typed TY_POLY has no emitter of its own for most of
   the builtin surface. What it has is a pretence: unbox the value to ONE
   concrete kind, retype the receiver node as that kind, and re-enter the
   typed emitter, which is then the implementation. This table says which
   kinds own which names, and both halves of the compiler read it -- the
   inference answers as the typed call would, under the same pin codegen
   installs, so the result slot and the emission agree by construction
   (#3449 introduced the shape for the Hash face; the String, Integer and
   Enumerable lists in the poly emitter grew separately and are folded in).

   A name several kinds own is dispatched on the receiver's run-time kind,
   one re-entry per owner (see the poly emitter); a name none owns falls
   through to whatever arm comes next, so this is not a catch-all and a name
   without a typed emitter still reports the missing method.

   A row marked PF_LAST answers only once no poly-receiver emitter of its own
   has claimed the name, because a claimed name's face answer is a type
   nothing renders (find and detect were such names -- their emitter walks
   the elements and answers one of them). The read-only Hash face is all
   PF_LAST; a Hash row ahead of it either reads alone (assoc) or carries
   PF_MUT and writes back, because the normalization copies every variant
   but the general one and a plain write would be lost. The table itself is
   in types.c. */
