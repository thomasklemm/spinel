/* repr.h -- a value's C representation, read off the analysis (#7100 Phase E).

   The type of a node or a local says what Ruby value it holds; how that
   value is laid out in C is decided by a handful of flags the analysis sets
   beside the type: a shared-mutable String read as its handle, a nilable
   Integer carried in its sentinel, a value-type object held by value, a
   read narrowed past a nil guard. repr_of gathers those flags into one
   answer, so the boxers and the readers can ask one question instead of
   each consulting the flags they know about.

   R0: the answer is computed purely from the live flags and nothing reads
   it yet. */
