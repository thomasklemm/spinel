   unreachable in practice (CRuby would have promoted it to Bignum), so

   reachable Integer, so a real -2147483648 flowing into an int? slot
   reads back as nil -- e.g. `[-2147483648].pop` yields nil instead of

   (non-nullable) int holding -2147483648 is fine, since it never
   consults sp_int_is_nil. The integer-overflow helpers deliberately do
   NOT reserve this value (checking every add/sub/mul result against it
   would cost the hot path the embedded build is trying to save). Code that
