# Spinel bundled `net/http` -- an HTTP/HTTPS client.
#
# The spelling is CRuby's, so a program written against it compiles here:
#
#     Net::HTTP.get(URI("https://example.com/"))
#     res = Net::HTTP.get_response(URI("https://example.com/"))
#     Net::HTTP.start(host, 443, use_ssl: true) { |http| http.request(req) }
#
# Pure Ruby over TCPSocket and the openssl package: nothing here speaks TLS,
# it asks OpenSSL::SSL::SSLSocket for a connection and then reads and writes
# lines. Which also means an https request needs the openssl package, and says
# so if it is missing rather than failing somewhere lower down.
#
# What is absent is absent the way a subset is, and a program naming it fails
# to compile rather than at run time:
#
# * HTTP/1.1 with `Connection: close`, one request per connection. There is no
#   keep-alive, no pipelining and no HTTP/2
# * no proxy support, no cookie jar, no automatic redirect following
#   (#get_response hands back the 3xx and its Location, as CRuby's does)
# * no streaming body block on #request; the body is read whole
# * chunked transfer decoding is here; content-encoding (gzip) is not
