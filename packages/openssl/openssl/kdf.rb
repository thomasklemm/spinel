# OpenSSL::KDF.hkdf -- HKDF (RFC 5869) -- and OpenSSL::KDF.pbkdf2_hmac /

#
# No C: HKDF is HMAC over raw bytes, extract then expand, and the raw HMAC
# spelling landed beside this file. Writing it in Ruby keeps it out of the
# OPENSSL_AVAILABLE gate -- a program that reaches HKDF through this package
# gets it whether or not the build found libcrypto's headers, the same way
# OpenSSL::Digest works.
