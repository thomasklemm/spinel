# Spinel bundled `pathname`.
#
# A Pathname is a String path with methods on it, so a path stops being an
# untyped string that any other string can be mistaken for. It carries no
# state beyond that string: two Pathnames with equal strings are equal, hash
# alike, and sort by string order.
#
# The split is the same as CRuby's. The pure-path half (#+, #parent,
# #cleanpath, #relative_path_from, #descend) is string manipulation and never
# touches the disk, so it answers for paths that do not exist. The rest
# delegates to File and Dir with the receiver as the path argument.
#
# This covers the surface a program actually reaches for rather than every
# CRuby corner. Not modelled: the Find/FileUtils-backed corners (#find is here
# but #each_entry, #chown, #lchmod are not), #opendir, #sysopen, #make_link /
# #make_symlink, #birthtime, and the mixed-in Kernel#Pathname() constructor,
# which cannot be spelled in Spinel yet (a toplevel method named after a class
# collides with the class's own symbol) -- use Pathname.new.
