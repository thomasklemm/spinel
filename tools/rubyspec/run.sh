# run.sh -- classify extracted ruby/spec examples against spinel.
#
# Usage: [REF_RUBY=~/.rbenv/versions/4.0.7/bin/ruby] tools/rubyspec/run.sh EXTRACTED_DIR [RESULTS_TSV]
#
# Per example: compile with spinel, run, and classify:
#   PASS         compiled, ran, MSPEC-DONE fail=0
#   FAIL         compiled, ran, some expectation failed
#   REJECT       spinel refused to compile (diagnostic recorded + clustered)
#   ERROR        compiled but crashed / timed out / no MSPEC-DONE line
#   HARNESS-SKEW CRuby itself does not pass the extracted program -- the
#                extraction changed meaning; excluded from spinel's score.
#
# Output: one TSV row per example + a summary + the reject-reason ranking,
# which is the "what to implement next" list this harness exists to produce.
#
# Environment knobs:
#   RUBYSPEC_ONLY=<file>  only run the examples named in <file> (one basename
#                         per line, no .rb suffix) -- the retention gate's input
#   RUBYSPEC_GATE=1       skip the CRuby oracle (gate runs re-check examples
#                         already known oracle-clean; CRuby need not be present)
#   RUBYSPEC_JOBS=<n>     parallelism (default: nproc-2, min 1)
#   GATE_CACHE=0          compile and run every example: by default an example
#                         whose generated C, source and build inputs are those
#                         of an earlier PASS reuses that PASS (the result
#                         cache, tools/result_cache.sh; the Makefile's comment
#                         above RUN_ONE_TEST has the reasoning)
