# Generate shared builtin arity facts in src/builtin_arity.inc from local
# CRuby. Method#arity is read directly; positional counts are probed.
# codegen_call.c projects the two independent facts into its three tables.
#
#   ruby tools/gen_builtin_arity_spec.rb            # print the shared rows
#   ruby tools/gen_builtin_arity_spec.rb --write    # regenerate the rows
#   ruby tools/gen_builtin_arity_spec.rb --check    # fail when the source
#                                                   # differs (make arity-spec-check)
#
# The builtin-op rows' argc_min/argc_max (builtin_ops.c) are checked against
# the instance spec table, and the Method#arity table against it too, by
# `spinel --check-bop-arity` (make bop-arity-check-test, in the gate).
#
# Probing technique, per (class, method):
#
#   1. Counts 0..3 are called with nil arguments to locate the true MINIMUM.
#      An outcome other than a "wrong number of arguments" ArgumentError -- a
#      TypeError, a RangeError, success -- proves the COUNT is accepted (the
#      values were the problem). This must run on NON-EMPTY receivers: several
#      C methods take an empty-receiver fast path that returns before the
#      arity check ("".delete never raises), which would hide the method.
#   2. A 99-argument call makes CRuby name the accepted range in its own
#      message ("given 99, expected 0..1"), yielding the MAXIMUM and CRuby's
#      exact wording. The low-side message is captured separately from a
#      (min-1)-argument call, because branch-implemented methods word the two
#      sides differently (Range#first: 0 args is a bare read, 1.. args is
#      "expected 1").
#   3. Every count 0..12 is then VERIFIED against the derived min/max. A
#      method whose accepted set is not one contiguous range (Time.utc takes
#      1..8 OR exactly 10) is left out -- unguarded -- rather than guessed.
#
# The instance surface probed is every public method of each receiver below;
# the class-method surface is the curated list. Anything the probe cannot
# prove is omitted, so the guard the tables drive fires only where CRuby
# itself would raise.
#
# Every method is probed twice: bare, and carrying an inert block ("2.step { }"
# accepts 0 args where the bare call wants a limit; Array#fill drops to 0..2).
# Each row holds both quartets; an unprovable side is the -1 sentinel quartet.
