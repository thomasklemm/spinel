# spawn through its own fork/exec with the same shell semantics.

# When called with `text:` the child's stderr is also accumulated into
# the given String (line by line, on a background thread that writes
# each line to $stderr so it still streams live to the operator). This
# is what compile()'s "cannot load such file" diagnostic needs: the
# live stream from run_command, plus the captured text for the hint
# check afterwards. Other call sites pass nothing and get the plain

# `spin pack`: a directory that builds the program from C alone -- no spinel,

#
# The recipe is DERIVED rather than written. `spinel --print-build` reports the
# ingredients the program REQUIRES -- its defines, include paths, libraries and
# link inputs -- and the Makefile below is those with their paths rewritten to
# the pack's own. A second copy of the build knowledge would drift, and a
# drifted copy breaks only on the machine the pack was sent to, which is the
# least diagnosable place for it to break.
#
# What the compiler does NOT report, and what this therefore does not carry, is
# which cc to run or how this particular build was run. Those are the
# recipient's: someone cross-compiling for another target brings their own
# toolchain and their own optimisation, and would not thank us for a Makefile
# carrying our -Werror, our diagnostic formatting and our linker's spelling of
# section GC. CC and CFLAGS below are defaults, not decisions.
#
# The runtime ships as SOURCE, not as the .a. That is not thoroughness: the
# generated C includes the runtime headers, and 270 of the runtime's functions
# are `static inline` in them, so the recipient compiles 16,765 lines of
# runtime either way. Shipping the .a would save the .c files and cost the
# thing the pack is for -- an archive is built for one platform and one set of
# defines (SP_THREADS above all), and a mismatched one links and then misbehaves
# at run time, because the generated TU writes its own externs and nothing
# cross-checks them.
# The probe's `#include` is spelled with printf's octal escape, so that no `#`
# reaches the Makefile at all. There is no spelling of a literal one that every
# make reads alike: before 4.3 a `#` inside a function invocation starts a
# comment and has to be written `\#`, and 4.3 both stopped treating it as a
# comment and stopped unescaping it, so `\#` resolves to a backslash and a hash
