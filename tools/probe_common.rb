# The runner the generated-case probes share (tools/call_binding_probe.rb,
# tools/value_flow_probe.rb): a covering array of a generator's factors, the
# cases run in batches under CRuby and under spinel, the differences split to
# the case that carries them, confirmed alone, reduced and reported.
#
# A generator is a module answering FACTORS ([name, levels] pairs, the first
# level of each its simplest), NAMES, SIMPLEST, GeneratorError, render(id, row) (a Case of the levels it realized, which render
# back to the same program), covering_cases(t, seed, tries, only, also), cases(rows),
# pinned_cases(rows, only), pins(spec), factor_list(spec),
# random_rows(n, seed), program(cases) (each case's lines under a heading
# `# case <id>:`), flags(cases) and shape(case), and
# optionally diff_kind(want, got, case) and FIXED (factors a reduction never
# steps). A probe names, beside it, the lines CRuby
# prints when a generated program reads a name it does not define. Covering gives a generator all but render,
# program, flags and shape from its FACTORS.
#
# A program spinel refuses, whose C does not build, that crashes, stops part
# way or runs out of time is split until one case carries the failure. The
# cases the failure names are tried alone first: those its diagnostics' lines
# are in (a C error's through spinel's #line map), or the first one it did
# not finish (for a crash or a timeout, as the program prints on a terminal,
# which loses no buffered lines). When they show the failure, the others are
# split in halves without them; else, and when no case is named, the program
# is split in halves. A difference seen in a program is confirmed on
# its case alone (unless --no-confirm takes it as the case's own: a run in
# which many cases differ spends most of its time confirming them). A
# failure no single case carries (two cases that only fail together) is
# kept as an `interaction`, with the program that showed it.
#
# Each finding is then reduced: one factor at a time steps toward its
# simplest level for as long as the case alone still makes the same kind of
# difference (for a case that does not build, asked of a build that stops at
# the C compiler's checks). The findings of a run are reduced simplest first, a few at a
# time; a finding that makes the same kind of difference as one reduced
# before it and takes every level that one still needs is taken to be that
# bug again and is not reduced itself -- it is listed under that finding's
# shape, its own program kept apart (DIR/<label>/absorbed/). That shortcut is
# a judgement, not a proof, and the summary says how many findings it
# absorbed. A reduction that runs out of steps says so.
#
# What counts as a finding follows the compiler's own contract. Ruby that
# does not parse is no case. An exception CRuby raises is part of the
# expected answer: spinel has to raise the same one. Spinel may refuse a
# program at compile time, naming the construct ("unsupported ...") rather
# than compile it wrong -- docs/limitations.md counts that a gap -- so a
# refusal (label compile-error) is reported in the `refused` tier. A
# difference docs/limitations.md describes as the answer on purpose (a
# probe's DOCUMENTED list) is reported in the `documented` tier, citing it.
# Everything else that differs is `wrong`: another answer, exception, order of
# evaluation or exit status (output-diff), C that does not build (link-error:
# the compiler should have refused), a compiler that fails without naming a
# construct (compiler-failure), a crash, a timeout, an interaction.
#
# Output, under DIR (the tool writes only its own files there, will not take
# a directory holding others, and runs one at a time in it): summary.txt
# (coverage, findings by tier and label, the failure rate of every factor
# level, the findings in families by the difference they make and in shapes
# by the factors they need) and <label>/case_<id>.rb, each finding's reduced
# case as a program of its own, with CRuby's answer and spinel's in a comment
# above it.
#
# Exit status: 0 no wrong answer, 1 a wrong answer, 4 the tool's own error.
# (A run is many programs, so unlike `spinel diff` one status summarizes it.)
