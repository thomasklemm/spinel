# repr_check.sh -- compile the corpus with --repr-check and count the boxes
# whose form differs from the one repr_of predicts (#7100 Phase E, R1).
#
#   tools/repr_check.sh [-v]
#
# Each difference is printed by the compiler with what explains it:
#   view           an override of the node's type is active
#   yield-site     a yield boxed by the block of its call site
#   transplant     a module's ivar read boxed by the including class's field
#   ran-first      an argument that already ran: the handle it read then
#   late-slot      a block parameter codegen marked nilable while binding it
#   literal        an empty literal, Hash.new or a splat, boxed by its shape
#   text-vs-node   boxed through emit_boxed_text with a type not the node's
#   conflict       none of the above: repr_box_form and the boxer disagree
# and for each store emit_coerce makes, its form against repr_coerce_form:
#   coerce-view    an override of the node's type is active
#   coerce-conflict  the store and the prediction disagree
# The counts are reported and the commonest conflict shapes listed. The run
# fails on a conflict, and when the C differs with the flag. The flag also
# has codegen ask repr_of of every node it emits (repr_check_ask), so a
# repr_of that changes anything codegen reads next shows as differing C.
