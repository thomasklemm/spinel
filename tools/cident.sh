#
#   tools/cident.sh <ref-rev>
#
# Compiles every program of the corpus (test/, benchmark/, packages/*/test/
# and optcarrot) to C with -c --no-line-map, once with the compiler of
# <ref-rev> and once with this tree's bin/spinel, and compares the files
# byte for byte. The reference tree is built in a worktree and its C is
# cached under build/cident/<sha>/, so comparing many commits against one
# base costs one build. Programs one side refuses and the other compiles
# are reported too: the set of refused programs must not change either.
#
# A refactor of the analysis -> codegen boundary (#7100) must report
# 0 differing and 0 refusal changes at every commit. Renumbered temps
# (_tN) count as a difference: they mean the emission order changed.
#
# CIDENT_FLAGS adds compiler flags to both sides (e.g.
# CIDENT_FLAGS=--int-overflow=promote); the reference cache is kept per
# flag set.
#
# Exit status: 0 identical, 1 some file differs, 2 infrastructure error.
