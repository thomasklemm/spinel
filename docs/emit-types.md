# `--emit-types`: the inferred types as JSON

```sh
spinel app.rb --emit-types            # -> app.types.json
spinel app.rb --emit-types -o out.json
```

`--emit-types` runs the whole compile (parse, analyze, codegen to a
discarded buffer) and writes what the compiler knew as JSON: a type for
every node it typed, and the diagnostics. No binary is written. The exit
status is the compile's: a program the compiler refuses exits 1 and the
JSON still carries the refusals. With `-S` as well
(`spinel app.rb --emit-types -o app.json -S`) the C of that same compile
goes to stdout, so a consumer showing both runs the compiler once. It is the surface the out-of-tree
editor tools read (rubys/spinel-ide); in this tree the gate's own check
reads it, and `tools/order_probe.rb`, which compiles a program in two
orders of its definitions and compares the two dumps node by node, and
`tools/dead_code_probe.rb`, which names the type a slot had before an
edit that never runs boxed it.

## `types`

One record per node the analyzer gave a concrete type (nodes typed
unknown or void are left out), in node order.

- `file`, `line`, `col`: the node's start, as Prism reports it (the line
  is 1-based, the column 0-based).
- `end_line`, `end_col`: Prism's exclusive end. Several expressions can
  start at one column (`pts`, `pts.map { }`, `pts.map { }.inspect`); the
  tightest span containing a position is the expression at it.
- `kind`: the Prism node type (`CallNode`, `LocalVariableReadNode`,
  `DefNode`, ...).
- `name`: present where the node names something: a call's method, a
  variable, a constant, a def, a parameter.
- A parameter has a record of its own (`RequiredParameterNode`,
  `OptionalParameterNode`, `RestParameterNode`, the keyword and block
  kinds, as Prism names them) at the parameter's span, whose `type` and
  `rbs` are the slot's: `untyped` for a widened one, so hover on the
  parameter says what the warning on it says, and go-to-definition on a
  read of it has a declaration to land on.
- `type`: spinel's internal type tag; `rbs`: the same type as RBS, which
  is the type language to read. A `DefNode`'s own type is the def
  expression's value (a `Symbol`); the method type it declares is its
  `signature`, `(Integer, Integer) -> Array[Integer]`, the text
  `--emit-rbs` writes for that method, with `"widened":true` when a slot
  of it degraded to untyped, `owner` naming the class it is defined in
  (`Object` at the top level) and `"singleton":true` for a `def self.x`.
  The signatures are all here, placed: a consumer does not need the
  `--emit-rbs` pass or a text scan for the defs.

## `diagnostics`

- `"severity":"warning"`, one per widened slot of a method whose
  signature degraded to untyped: `method` names the def, `slot` is
  `"param"` (with `param`, the parameter's name; the position is the
  parameter's) or `"return"` (the position is the def's). The
  `signature` in `types` at the def shows the whole method type.
- `"severity":"error"`, one per refusal, in the order the compile met
  them, at the refused construct: the same lines the compile prints on
  stderr ([limitations.md](limitations.md) says what a refusal is).
- A program that does not parse exits 1 too, and the JSON is still
  written: `types` and `codegen` empty, and one `"severity":"error"` per
  parse error at its span (`end_line`/`end_col` included), in the file
  it is in when a `require_relative` spliced it -- the same
  `file:line:col: message` lines the compile prints on stderr (where the
  column is 1-based, as an editor reads it; the JSON's is 0-based).

A plain compile says nothing about a widened slot. `--warn-widen` prints
the same warnings on stderr during any compile, one per slot at the
slot, in the form the other warnings take, and under each the *why*:
the chain from the value that widened the slot to the expression the
untyped was born at, one `note:` per hop:

```
spinel: app.rb:4:13: warning: parameter `o` of `dist2` widened to untyped (boxed poly slow path)
spinel: app.rb:11:28: note: passed `pts[0]` is untyped
spinel: app.rb:10:7: note: from `[Point.new(1, 2), Point.new(3, 4)]` is Array[untyped] -- born here: no untyped input
```

The column is 1-based there, as an editor reads a compiler's warning;
the JSON's is 0-based. The same chain is the record's `why`, an array
of hops `{file, line, col, end_line, end_col, role, rbs, note?}` in
order from the slot outward. `role` is what the first hop is to the
slot -- `passed` (an argument), `written` (an assigned value),
`returned` (a returned value) -- then `from` for each expression the
untyped came in through, `and` for the other side of a meeting, `by`
for a rule's subject and `rule` for a rule with none. A
hop through a send on an untyped receiver whose builtin answer is
concrete (`to_s` is a String on anything) does not follow the receiver:
it names the user def of that name whose return degraded and continues
from that return, since one such makes every `.to_s` on an untyped
receiver untyped, program-wide:

```
spinel: app.rb:10:16: note: returned `v.to_s` is untyped (a candidate of the send, `Bad#to_s`, returns untyped)
spinel: app.rb:7:14: note: returned `@v` is untyped
```

A chain ends one of these ways, said in the last hop's `note`:

- **born here: no untyped input** -- the expression produced the untyped
  with no untyped operand (a literal array of objects, a `map` over
  them, `&.`); the rule is the compiler's, and this is where to look.
- **two kinds meet** -- the slot held one concrete kind and this value
  brought another; the `and` hop is the other kind's site (for a
  return, the `return` of the other kind).
- **by representation** -- an empty literal whose slot was filled with
  objects (`r = []; r << Foo.new`): an Array of objects has no typed
  form, so the slot is `Array[untyped]` whatever round typed it.
- **pessimistic** -- an empty literal whose slot nothing had typed on
  the round it took untyped, and nothing concrete filled later. A
  fixpoint imprecision when a later write would have typed it.
- **a transient** -- the value is not untyped in the end, but was on the
  round the slot took it; the fixpoint kept the slot there. A compiler
  imprecision, and a report worth filing with the program.
- **a rule's own words** -- a rule rather than a value widened the slot,
  and the hop is the rule's subject with `role` `by` (the default's
  expression) or, with no subject, a hop of `role` `rule` with only a
  `note`: *never bound: no call site gives it a type*; *by construction*
  (a `*rest` or `**kwrest` parameter); *a `= nil` default and no call
  site typing it* (the parameter holds nil or a value; a Symbol or Bool
  one is boxed, having no nil of its own); *an empty literal default*
  (`h = {}`, no element type); *an empty `[]` argument and no other call
  site typing it*; *an empty literal argument of one container kind
  where another call site passed the other*. A chain that reaches a
  read of such a parameter ends the same way.
- **untraced** -- a widening this version does not record the source of.

## `codegen`

What codegen decided, one record per call it placed and per block:

- a `CallNode` carries `dispatch`: `"direct"` (one statically bound C
  call, or a builtin emitted in place: the fast path), `"switch"` (a
  switch over the classes or tags the receiver can hold, each arm a
  direct call), or `"boxed"` (the receiver is a boxed value and a runtime
  helper answers over its tag; an unresolved call is here too).
- a `"direct"` call to a user def carries `callee`, the def it bound to:
  `Point#dist2` for an instance method, `Point.make` for a singleton, the
  bare name for a top-level def (the spelling a `DefNode`'s `owner`,
  `singleton` and `name` compose to). A `"switch"` carries `candidates`,
  the arms' defs in arm order (`["A#f","B#f"]`); an inherited def appears
  once, under the class that defines it. A builtin emitted in place and a
  boxed send carry neither.
- a `BlockNode` carries `inlined`: `true` when the block was spliced into
  its caller (an iterator's body, a yielding method's block), `false`
  when it became a function of its own (a proc or lambda, a `Fiber.new`
  or `Thread.new` body).

A call the compiler never placed (unreachable, or folded into something
else) has no record. The lens is per site: the one call in a method that
took a switch or the boxed path is the one to look at.

Why a slot widened is the record's `why` (above). Deriving it costs
the analysis (the origin walk, +10% on optcarrot), so it runs only
under `--warn-widen` and `--emit-types`; a plain compile's inference
and C are the same either way.
