# An ivar's String stored into an Array or Hash whose elements are appended
# to is the ivar's own object: the append shows through the ivar, as it
# does for a local stored the same way. The ivar never took the shared
# handle (#6179) for such a store, and the element was wrapped as a fresh
# handle over a copy of its text, so the append was lost to the ivar.
