# A String written ahead of a splat, with an optional parameter before the
# rest and a required one after it: how long the splat runs decides which
# parameter takes the String (here a when e has an element, z when it is
# empty), and the one that appends would grow a copy out of the gathered
# Array. Refused rather than compiled with the append lost (#6179).
