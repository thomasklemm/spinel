# A top-level ivar handed to a parameter the method appends to is lent its
# C slot (civ_Toplevel_x), and the method assigns the ivar before it
# appends: through the slot the append would reach the new String, where
# CRuby appends to the one passed (it prints "new"). Refused at compile
# time until such an ivar is shared by reference (#6179).
