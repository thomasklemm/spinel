# A `Hash.new { |h, k| ... }` default block runs with a frame of its own: it
# may write locals, read and write the enclosing scope's, run an iteration
# block, and make a block or a lambda that outlives it. The block was
# emitted as a bare C function declaring only the hash and the key, so each
# of these named an identifier it never declared, and a proc made inside it
# had its own function written into the middle of this one: the C build
# failed. Such a block is now a real proc the hash's default calls.
