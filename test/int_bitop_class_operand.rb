# spinel: int64
# An Integer's &, | and ^ with a Class or Module operand is CRuby's TypeError
# ("Class can't be coerced into Integer"), and a shift's is the conversion
# error ("no implicit conversion of Class into Integer"); a constant defined
# nowhere raises its NameError as it is read. The typed path put the operand
# into the C operator as an sp_Class, and the C did not build; a boxed Class
# operand was read as the integer 0.
