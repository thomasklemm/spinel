# `self.class` in a method of a reopened Hash, Array or String is that
# builtin -- no program class may derive from it -- so `self.class.new`
# builds one: activesupport's Hash#extract! collects into
# `self.class.new`. It was resolved to the reopening as a user class of its
# own, whose constructor and struct do not exist, and the C did not compile.
# A Numeric reopening serves Integer and Float alike, and a program's own
# Text::String is a class of its own: both keep the run-time answer.
