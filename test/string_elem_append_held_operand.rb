# A String pushed into an Array whose element is appended to later
# (`@a << +"x"`, then `@a[0] << "!"`) is stored as a shared handle, wrapped
# around the String where the element is stored. When the push's operands
# are held in temps in Ruby's order (an ivar receiver, or a sibling call
# that can run code), the String's temp was declared as the handle, an
# sp_String *, for the const char * it holds, and the C did not build.
