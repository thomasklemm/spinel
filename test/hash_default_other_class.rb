# Hash#default= with a default of another class than the Hash's values. A
# Hash whose values are all Integers or all Strings keeps them, and its
# default, in a typed slot, and the default was assigned there as it was: a
# Float was truncated, true read as 1 and a Symbol as its id, and a String
# or a boxed default did not build. CRuby answers the default for a missing
# key, so it is value evidence as a store is: the Hash's values widen for
# it, in a local, an instance, class or global variable, or a Hash a method
# answers. A default of the values' class keeps the typed Hash, and so does
# a nil literal, which a missing key answers anyway; a local that holds nil
# is boxed, so it widens the Hash as another class does.
