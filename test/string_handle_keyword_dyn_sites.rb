# A String passed by keyword reaches a proc, a kept block or a method as
# the caller's String wherever one passed by position does (#6469 shared
# the keyword at a proc's and a Method's own call). Through a yield into a
# block the method keeps, a yield into a proc passed with `&`, a proc read
# out of a slot that holds other values, `instance_exec`, and an
# UnboundMethod's `bind_call` or `bind(o).call`, the keyword was refused
# while the position was shared. Each probe appends LONG, which always
# reallocates, and has its own variable.
